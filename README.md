### MAGIC LEAP

- Here are a few helpful links to help you get started with Magic Leap Development! 
- Sign up for a developer ID here at our developer portal. https://developer.magicleap.com/home 

- First time setup: https://developer.magicleap.com/learn/guides/develop-setup - in order to get access to the Lumin SDK, you will need to download The Lab located in the hyperlink above. 

- To convert a section of google maps to 3d maps in unity using 3d map generator (adobe plugin - 21 USD)
Terrain.party - move map to the desired location then save file, but remember at which km it was scaled at.

### MAGIC MAPS

Tools that we used -  https://www.3d-map-generator.com/ which was the fastest compared to mapbox unity which wasnâ€™t compatible well with magic leap due to rendering issues, luckily files exported from adobe as an obj, mtl and png file just in case a texture.

Made the maps with 3d map generator adobe plugin and height mapper. 
Then transfer the obj and mtl file to unity3d and then insert a png if no texture shows up.
