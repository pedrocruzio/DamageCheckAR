## Augmented Reality Earthquake Damage Assessment Tool / Simulator

### Visual Analysis of Structural Damage to Buildings, Walls & Columns 

#### - [MagicLEAP Augmented Reality](https://developer.magicleap.com/home)
#### - iOS Mobile Application [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) & [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)

# Installation

### [MagicLeap Developer](https://developer.magicleap.com/learn/guides/develop-setup)

- Here are a few helpful links to help you get started with Magic Leap Development! 
- Sign up for a developer ID here at our developer portal. https://developer.magicleap.com/home 

- First time setup: https://developer.magicleap.com/learn/guides/develop-setup - in order to get access to the Lumin SDK, you will need to download The Lab located in the hyperlink above. 

- To convert a section of google maps to 3d maps in unity using 3d map generator (adobe plugin - 21 USD)
Terrain.party - move map to the desired location then save file, but remember at which km it was scaled at.

### MAGIC MAPS

- Tools that we used -  https://www.3d-map-generator.com/ which was the fastest compared to mapbox unity which wasnâ€™t compatible well with magic leap due to rendering issues, files exported from adobe as an obj, mtl and png file just in case a texture.

- Made the maps with 3d map generator adobe plugin and height mapper. 
Then transfer the obj and mtl file to unity3d and then insert a png if no texture shows up. 

## Inspiration

- Creating Augmented Reality Experience to Assess & Simulate Earthquake Damage

## What it does

- Distinguishing Earthquake Damage and Structural Integrity through Visual Inspection 

## How we built it

- MagicLEAP Augmented Reality
- Unity3D 
- 3D Map Generator - Adobe Plugin 
- Google Maps Satellite Images
- 8th Wall
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe XD
- iMovie
- CoreML
- ARKit 
 
## Challenges we ran into

- 3D Map Generation Cannot Render in Real-Time, Hardware Issues with SDK & Building Application, Operating System Drivers Incompatibility, Importing 3D Models, Scaling Environmental Variables, Integrating Audio Cues, Utilizing AR Hardware 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

- Scaling 3D Models in MagicLeap Augmented Reality, Linking Structural Audio Cues, Creating Interactive Spacial Experiences for Earthquake Simulation, Cross Platform AR & Mobile Integration 

## What we have learned

- MagicLeap AR Development, 3D Map Generation, Stereo to Mono Audio Conversions, Domain Knowledge / Types of Structural Damage to Walls, Columns & Foundations, 

## What's next for DamageCheckAR

- iOS Mobile Application for Visual Inspection with Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
